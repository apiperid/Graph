# Graph

This repository is about analyzing a graph using Matlab.
More specifically all graphs can be written at a csv format (links between nodes) and can be viewed as arrays.
We created some .m files (codes folder) in which we wrote some functions useful in graph theory.
The codes provided were created when i was undergraduated student at electrical and computer engineering (AUTH) at semester 9.
Every .m file has a very good explanation in comment form of what it is doing.
